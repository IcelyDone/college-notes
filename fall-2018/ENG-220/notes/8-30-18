                                  PRE-CLASS
                         (A Good Man Is Hard To Find)

-Grandmother is hypocritical. She asks for her children to be respectful yet
she herself is not respectful whatsoever:
    -Doesn't care about where his son wants to go, cares about her wants more
      -Lmao she makes the excuse about the Misfit, yet because she got what she
        wanted she ironically ran into him.
    -Lectures her grandchildren about respect yet she makes fun of black children
    -Lies (about the secret panel in the house) to try and get what she wants
      -Because of her selfishness, the car went off-course; and
        because of her clumsiness they got into an accident.
        -She has the audacity to claim an injured organ (falsely) when
          her son's wife broke a shoulder. Disgusting.

-She is not respected in the story because she isn't given a name

-Her response in the face of death is to pray. Classic.

-The only girl with a name, June Star (the granddaughter) is a spoiled brat:
  -Never marry a gentleman because of his watermelon
  -Insulted the barbecue house (especially the wife),
    and was encouraged by the grandmother.

-Red Sam isn't as kind as he advertises himself to be:
  -Chains monkeys to trees
  -Nags his wife
-Wife doesn't trust her husband

?- What is this about charging the gas? Don't understand about the trust issue.

"People are certainly not nice like they used to be" - Grandmother
  -Lmao she's the reason why

"You could be honest too if you'd only try," said the grandmother.
  -Why is she one to talk

~~ "I never was a bad boy that I remember of," The Misfit said in an
almost dreamy voice, "but somewheres along the line I done something
wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. I was buried alive," and he looked
up and held her attention to him by a steady stare. ~~

~~  "It was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what I had done was kill my
  daddy but I known that for a lie. My daddy died in nineteen ought
  nineteen of the epidemic flu and I never had a thing to do with it. He was
  buried in the Mount Hopewell Baptist churchyard and you can go there
  and see for yourself."
  "If you would pray," the old lady said, "Jesus would help you."
   "That's right," The Misfit said.
   "Well then, why don't you pray?" she asked trembling with delight
  suddenly.
   "I don't want no hep," he said. "I'm doing all right by myself." ~~

~~ "No, lady,"
The Misfit said while he was buttoning it up, "I found out the crime don't
matter. You can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a
tire off his car, because sooner or later you're going to forget what it was
you done and just be  punished for it." ~~

(So did he do that crime or not...?)

~~ Yes'm," The Misfit said as if he agreed. "Jesus thown everything off
balance. It was the same case with Him as with me except He hadn't
committed any crime and they could prove I had committed one because
they had the papers on me. Of course," he said, "they never shown me my
papers. That's why I sign myself now. I said long ago, you get you a
signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. Then you'll
know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment
and see do they match and in the end you'll have something to prove you
ain't been treated right. I call myself The Misfit," he said, "because I can't
make what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment."

~~  She saw the man's face
twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured,
"Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!" She
reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if
a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then
he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to
clean them. ~~
