-Born in January 22, 1788 in London, England as George Gordon Byron to a decaying aristocratic family; taken to Scotland soon after his birth and spent his childhood there.
  -John Byron had a reputation for being money-hungry and womanizing; remarried to Catherine Gordon, a descendent of James I of Scotland. Spent most of her money; had a hard time tolerating his family before moving away dying in 1791, deep in debt.
  -Just like both of his parents, Byron's early life was one of difficulty: he had a mentally shaken mother (from his father's "brutal and vicious" treatment), and he was born with clubfoot. Despite this, he had a childhood of play and mischief; he was regarded as a genius at school even with his halfheartedness towards his academia.

-At age 10 his great-uncle died, and he inherited his title (became known as Lord Byron) and his property, the Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire.

-Went to a prodigious high school in Harrow in 1801
  - (1803) Fell in love with Mary Chaworth (distant cousin) who rejected him, and became
  a symbol of unattainable love.

-Trinity college in 1805; his ambivalent sexuality distinguished itself.

-Published a book of poetry called Hours of Idleness in 1807; this is where he got his initial recognition

-Upon graduating Trinity in 1809, took his seat in the house of lords (UK equivalent of Congress) and toured the Mediterranean with John Hobhouse (friend from college) over the next two years; started to write "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" in Greece, a story involving a young man's reflections on travel in foreign lands (published in 1812).

-Returned to London in 1811, being unable to return before his mother's death.
  -Plunged into a melancholy despite her failings.

-In 1812, Byron published the first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, and as a result "I awoke one morning and found myself famous", as he said.

-A year later he became anomorously intimate with his half-sister Augusta (his father's daughter from his first marriage), which served as an inspiration for his poetry.

-Trying to escape this, he proposed to Annebella Milkbanke in late 1814, and they married in Jan 1815; they had a daughter. A year later she left him (he was drinking heavily, in debt, and upon hearing rumors of his incest and bisexuality) and took the child, and he never saw them again.

-As a result of this, he exiled himself from England in 1816, never to return. It is in Geneva, Switzerland where he met Percy Shelley, his wife, and her stepsister Claire Clairmont. Later that year the three depart to England, leaving behind Byron with Claire carrying his daughter.

-Traveled to Rome in 1817. Spent the next five years of his life throughout Italy, writing
cantos to Don Juan. This satire was his most famous poem, and he wrote cantos to this for the remainder of his life.

-Met Teresa Guiccioli, a married countess, during this time and she separated with her former husband to marry Byron in 1818.

-Sailed to Greece in 1823, where he spent the last year of his life dedicated to the Greek freedom movement. This was relatively unsuccessful, as his only contribution was spending his wealth helping people (commanded a Greek navy, but with no victories or notable accomplishments)

-In 1824 fell ill, and subsequently developed a violent cold which was "treated with theurapeutic bleeding". This led to infection and a death after a violent fever.
