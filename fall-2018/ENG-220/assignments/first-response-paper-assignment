DUE DATE: September 13, beginning of class. Papers submitted after class begins
will lose one full grade (in other words, make sure you get to class on time).
No extensions, no late papers accepted. I do not accept e-mail or Blackboard submissions.


Write an essay of approximately 500 to 700 words (2 to 3 pages) in response
to the question below. All papers must be typed, double-spaced,
with standard margins and fonts. Staple or clip all pages,
and make sure that your name and the page number appear in
the upper right hand corner of every page.
You are not required to use secondary sources for this paper, but you may certainly do so.
Any secondary sources should be authoritative:
recognized scholars in the field, published in academic journals,
by university presses or other reputable publishers.
It is your responsibility to make sure that your sources are authoritative.
(Wikipedia is NOT an acceptable source under any circumstances.)
All sources, both primary and secondary, should be cited according to MLA form.
If you are not familiar with MLA form, get a handout from the Writing Center,
consult a style manual, go to the mla.org website
(or any of a number of websites that have the MLA style sheet available
to download or print), or consult The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers,
which is the most comprehensive source.



Flannery O’Connor and Eudora Welty are viewed as authors who often
dealt with morality and ethics. O’Connor made no secret of being a devout Catholic;
Welty frequently addressed the moral issues of the day.
Analyze the moral implications of “A Good Man is Hard to Find” and
“Why I Live at the P.O.” Specifically, you may want to consider the way
the authors dealt with one or more of a range of issues, among them honesty,
deceitfulness, jealousy, arrogance, hubris, unfaithfulness, even murder.
