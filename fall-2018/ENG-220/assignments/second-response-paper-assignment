Paul Alexander
English 220: Writing About Literature
Second Response Paper — Fiction

DUE DATE: October 2, beginning of class. Papers submitted after class begins will lose one full grade (in other words, make sure you get to class on time). No extensions, no late papers accepted. I do not accept e-mail or Blackboard submissions.

Write an essay of approximately 500 to 700 words (2 to 3 pages) in response to ONE of questions below. All papers must be typed, double-spaced, with standard margins and fonts. Staple or clip all pages, and make sure that your name and the page number appear in the upper right hand corner of every page. You are not required to use secondary sources for this paper, but you may certainly do so. Any secondary sources should be authoritative: recognized scholars in the field, published in academic journals, by university presses or other reputable publishers. It is your responsibility to make sure that your sources are authoritative. (Wikipedia is NOT an acceptable source under any circumstances.) All sources, both primary and secondary, should be cited according to MLA form. If you are not familiar with MLA form, get a handout from the Writing Center, consult a style manual, go to the mla.org website (or any of a number of websites that have the MLA style sheet available to download or print), or consult The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, which is the most comprehensive source.


QUESTION 1: As we have discussed, Mary Shelley was the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft, one of the leading feminist thinkers of her generation. In many ways, Shelley herself was a feminist in her own life. Did her feminist beliefs translate to her work? Analyze the way Shelley portrays women in Frankenstein. Be specific in your analysis, quoting from the novel as needed.

QUESTION 2: One of the aspects of Frankenstein that makes the novel successful is its method of narration. Analyze Mary Shelley’s narrative approach in the novel. Why did she choose this means of narration? What effect does she create by showing various characters’ points of view? Consider specifically Victor and the monster.
