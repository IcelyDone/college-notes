  In both “A Good Man is Hard to Find” and “Why I Live at the P.O.”,
characters attempt to get what they want through the manipulation and deceit of
those around them.
However, despite how easy or immediately rewarding it might be to do so, such
satisfaction gained by dishonest means is rarely without consequential
dissatisfaction; in other words, it doesn't pay to lie to others to get what you want
because you're almost guaranteed to end up with something you never wanted.



P1:
  The most blatant example of this in "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is the grandmother.
    -Ended up in the middle of nowhere by manipulating the kids with the secret panel
      (only thought of where she wanted to go for the vacation)
    -Would have been able to avoid the Misfit if she didn't manipulate the family
      to going where she wanted

    Red Sam?
    -Barbecuing monkeys
    -Unhappy wife
    -Complains of no man being good despite he himself not being

P2:
  A somewhat less obvious example in "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is the Misfit himself.
    -A product of dishonesty
    -Was lied to about his father's death and was put innocently in prison
    -Had no choice but to become a criminal
    -Forgot everything bad he did, but did not forget his father's death
    -Never lied despite becoming a murderer
P3:
  In "Why I Live At The PO", Sister does not let the manipulation of Stella-Ronda
  go unanswered.
