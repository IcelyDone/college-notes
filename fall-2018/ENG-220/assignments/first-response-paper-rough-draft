A child and his younger sibling have been each given an identical quantity of candy. This child would typically eat his candy with alongside his sibling, understanding they are both receiving and deserving of equal treatment. However, some children in this scenario would attempt to obtain more than he is given (obtain an unequal share) through various underhanded means: a brash few might attempt to steal and eat their sibling's candy directly, others might give a false reason to their sibling for deserving more, and a sly few might scour the house to locate the stash of candy, only to eat it all themselves. In any scenario with which the child eats more candy than he deserves, he is taking advantage of others (the feebleness of the sibling, the gullibleness of the sibling, or the inattentiveness of the parents) for his sole benefit; and in all of these scenarios the child will be worse off for having been selfishly dishonest (the sibling will
harbor animosity towards his greedy older sibling, the parents might punish/scold the child for his selfishness, or, if nothing happens to him, he would be positively reinforcing his own deceitful behavior, leaving him more likely to do it again in the future).
 	In both “A Good Man is Hard to Find” and “Why I Live at the P.O.”, characters as immature as the child wanting more candy attempt to get what they want through the manipulation and deceit of those around them. However, despite how easy or immediately rewarding it might be to do so, such satisfaction gained at the expense of the satisfaction of others is rarely without consequential dissatisfaction; in other words, it doesn't pay to lie solely for one's benefit because they're almost guaranteed to end up with something they never wanted.




P1: The most blatant example of this in "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is the grandmother.
    -Ended up in the middle of nowhere by manipulating the kids with the secret pane
  (only thought of where she wanted to go for the vacation)
    -Would have been able to avoid the Misfit if she didn't manipulate the family
 	     to going where she wanted
   Red Sam?
    -Barbecuing monkeys (deceiving customers)
    -Unhappy wife
    -Complains of no man being good despite he himself not being one
P2:  In "Why I Live At The PO", Sister does not let the manipulation of Stella-Ronda
  go unanswered.
      -Stella-Ronda deceives mother, uncle, grandpa; all for them to be against Sister
      -Sister disconnects herself from the family just so she could live without deceit
      -The family will miss her presence whether they want to or not.
P3:
    A somewhat less obvious example in "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is the Misfit himself.
      -A product of dishonesty
      -Was lied to about his father's death and was put innocently in prison
      -Had no choice but to become a criminal
      -Forgot everything bad he did, but did not forget his father's death
      -Never lied despite becoming a murderer
