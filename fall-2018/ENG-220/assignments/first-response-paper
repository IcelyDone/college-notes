  We all know someone that deceives and manipulates others to get what they want: they disregard the wants or needs of others in favor of their own, they use underhanded tactics to satisfy their desires, and [they are not a presence well tolerated?]. In Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man is Hard to Find" and "Why I Live At The P.O." by Eudora Welty, characters such as the grandmother and Stella-Ronda fits the aforementioned paradigm of deceitful and manipulative people. However, selfishly deceiving others is always eventually met with repercussions.
  The most blatant example of repercussions brought on by deceit and manipulation in these stories would be the grandmother. Despite being the eldest and supposedly the most mature and patient, the grandmother could never stand to sacrifice her wants for those of others. So instead of being considerate and compromising between these different wants (or even entirely forsaking her own), she took the selfish alternative: do whatever it takes to assert her desires onto others. The most consequential instance of this is when she wants to visit a house from her youth; the grandmother lies about a secret panel in the house to get the children in the car excited, knowing they would throw a fit if they didn't get to see it. Manipulating Bailey the driver by deceiving the obnoxious grandchildren, the grandmother gets what she wants and has the whole family driving down an unused dirt road that leads the family to the middle of nowhere. This eventually results in a crash and an encounter with the Misfit. The grandmother deceives, and so the repercussions were what she and her entire family receives. Also, she is so morally corrupt that she is completely unable to keep from deceiving even herself; when face to face with death (the Misfit), the grandmother hypocritically offered advice she couldn't uphold herself. She told the Misfit that "You could be honest too if you'd only try...", yet whose dishonesty was it that got them into that giant mess in the first place?
  Stella-Ronda is also a morally corrupt individual who turned to manipulation and deceived her family against an opposing individual. She had clearly done something blasphemous, coming home without her husband and a two-year-old child that was clearly her own, and yet all of her family members accept a half-assed excuse wholeheartedly; except for Sister. And it is exactly because of this  

This is a free type, as it were. I am supposed to type my thoughts as they flow regardless of how incoherent and inconprehensible they are, just to get my thoughts out. Something something something oh I know, I need to finish this essay by this time tomorrow. I have 24 hours to write 3 more paragraphs, huh it's not as bad as I originally thought. OF course, I ened to proofread everything and make sure that its' not gramatically incorrect and all polished to be handed in, but I suppose it's really not as bad as my sub subconscious made it out to be just earlier. IT's really not that bad. YOu know what was definitely not bad? That oolong bubble tea that I bought earlier for a fairly decent price. I could actually taste tea, much better than that garbage ripoff that is available right down the block from college. I the bubbles were a lot crisper too, nothing to complain about tbh. Although what I did make a mistake of doing was having too much ice in my tea. I should make a correction for that next time. And maybe a little less sugar? Nah, it doesn't really matter, I suppose. One thing I have to make sure I do for this weekend is try and practice singing a song.

  P1: The most blatant example of this in "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is the grandmother.
      -Ended up in the middle of nowhere by manipulating the kids with the secret pane
    (only thought of where she wanted to go for the vacation)
      -Would have been able to avoid the Misfit if she didn't manipulate the family
   	     to going where she wanted
     Red Sam?
      -Barbecuing monkeys (deceiving customers)
      -Unhappy wife
      -Complains of no man being good despite he himself not being one
  P2:  In "Why I Live At The PO", Sister does not let the manipulation of Stella-Ronda
    go unanswered.
        -Stella-Ronda deceives mother, uncle, grandpa; all for them to be against Sister
        -Sister disconnects herself from the family just so she could live without deceit
        -The family will miss her presence whether they want to or not.
  P3:
      A somewhat less obvious example in "A Good Man is Hard to Find" is the Misfit himself.
        -A product of dishonesty
        -Was lied to about his father's death and was put innocently in prison
        -Had no choice but to become a criminal
        -Forgot everything bad he did, but did not forget his father's death
        -Never lied despite becoming a murderer
