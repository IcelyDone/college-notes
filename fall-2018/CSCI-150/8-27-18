__Arithmetic sequence:__
  -A term that is sequentially incremented additively (a,a+d,a+2d,...)
  -Number of terms: n = (max-min)/d + 1

Rule 1: Xn = a + d(n-1)
Rule 2: [n-1]Sigma[k=0](a+dk)
Rule 3: [n-1]Sigma[k=0](a+dk) = n/2(2a + d(n-1))
  a=1 (first term)
  d=3 (common difference)
  n=8 (number of terms)
